## What is a Flock?

Federated Learning is done over a scattered collection of devices that collectively train a machine learning model. In
FLoX, we refer to the topology that defines these devices and their connectivity as a ***Flock***, coined after a flock
of birds.

## Creating Flock Networks

The ``flox.flock`` module contains the code needed to define your own ``Flock`` networks. They are built on top of
the ``NetworkX``  library. Generally speaking, to create Flock instances in FLoX, we provide two interfaces:

1. interactive mode
2. file mode

Interactive mode involves creating a ``NetworkX.DiGraph()`` object directly and then passing that into the ``Flock``
constructor. This is **not** recommended.

The recommended approach is ***file mode***. In this mode, you define the Flock network using a supported file type (
e.g., `*.yaml`) and simply use it to create the Flock instance.

```python
from flox.topos import Topology

f = "my_flock.yaml"
flock = Topology.from_yaml(f)
```
