"""
This submodule contains default implementations of well-known federated learning strategies (or algorithms)
from the academic literature. These include:

- [`FedSGD`][flox.strategies.impl.fedsgd.FedSGD]
- [`FedAvg`][flox.strategies.impl.fedavg.FedAvg]
- [`FedProx`][flox.strategies.impl.fedprox.FedProx]

## Any missing strategies you have in mind? :huh:
Please feel free to implement them and contribute them to the repository with a pull request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nathaniel-hudson/FLoX)! :smile:
